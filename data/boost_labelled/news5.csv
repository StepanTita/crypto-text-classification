;BandChain V2.4 Upgrade;;;1;https://medium.com/bandprotocol/bandchain-v2-4-upgrade-70dbb896618c;"“Delivering 10X throughput with this biggest upgrade to date”
Since the launch of Laozi-testnet-6 last week, and having enabled the latest IBC version, we are now so excited to announce that we are ready for the next BandChain 2.4 upgrade to our community! This significant latest upgrade to our chain will impose fundamental changes to multiple things — one of which is how gas is calculated on the BandChain. This results in an improved user experience as well as throughput time on our network. Before going through the details of this latest upgrade, let us provide you with a brief recap of the current version.
In our previous version, Owasm (Oracle WebAssembly) utilized the ‘inject gas’ technique to calculate the amount of gas that would be used to run a Wasm script. An Oracle Script (OS) leverages this technique that inputs a gas consumption function into the Wasm code; there was no inherent mechanism that can be used to calculate gas innately in the OS itself.
Although secure, this workaround technique in our previous version meant that the BandChain was operating less efficiently than it could be. This is due to the fact that the gas consumption function, injected into the Wasm OS code, would in turn call the gas function on the host environment which could, in an anomalous case, lead to delays. Therefore, to handle these anomaly cases, we have had to lower our gas limit and gas multiplier. This was holding us back from reaching our full potential.



Chain 2.4 Version Upgrade Achievements
With this upgrade, we use the new Metering Middleware from Wasmer, a fast and secure WebAssembly runtime, to calculate gas consumption instead of using the ‘inject gas’ technique. This transition allows the OS to efficiently calculate gas consumption in a manner that is not only more methodical, but also structurally more sound. There are 4 major advantages in doing this:
	More streamlined code interaction as the Middleware is on the same level as Owasm code
	Total elimination of any risk to modifications of the Wasm code
	Customizable Metering Middleware that allows for a more flexible gas consumption calculation
	Ultimately a much faster network
In addition, as we fine-tuned the Metering Middleware, we are able to achieve a reliable formula whereby we can accurately calculate the execution time based on gas calculated. This is also applicable to all instructions on the BandChain as well as those imported from the host environment. Above all, these improvements on the key elements of the BandChain has led to a much faster network.



Increased Throughput by at least 10X
This improved efficiency also comes from minimizing the required gas as we are able to decrease the required work range threshold when calculating the required gas for a particular work. The graph below illustrates this massive achievement."

After stealing the spotlight in 2021, the SOL token has now lost more value percentage-wise than most other major altcoins.  According to the cryptocurrency researcher, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, might still plunge lower despite losing more than 70% of its value. 
In fact, based on historical data, CryptoCompare has predicted that Bitcoin could be on pace to record its biggest drawdown in history in 2022.

;Why Twitter Could Prove To Be The Ultimate Elon Musk-Backed Catalyst For $1 DOGE Dream Price;;;0;https://zycrypto.com/why-twitter-could-prove-to-be-the-ultimate-elon-musk-backed-catalyst-for-1-doge-dream-price/;"	Dogecoin has gained over 100% in the last ten days as bulls rub their hands in glee for even larger gains.
	The price rally has been attributed to Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, with some speculating that DOGE will be integrated into the platform.
	DOGE short traders suffered liquidations in excess of 50 million over the weekend during the meteoric rally.
After several months in the doldrums of lethargic price movements, Dogecoin bucked the trend over the weekend, and enthusiasts have Elon Musk to thank for the spike.
Last week, Elon Musk’s purchase of microblogging site Twitter became official in a $44 billion deal that created ripples of excitement throughout the digital assets industry. The effect of the sale was visible in the price movement of Dogecoin (DOGE) as it climbed to its highest point in five months.
Days after sealing the deal, DOGE gained 106% to reach $0.1494 in a blistering move, and only seven days earlier, the asset was hovering at the $0.0588 mark. The market capitalization for DOGE surpassed Cardano and Solana over the weekend and pegged at $16.5 billion, while trading volumes in the last 24 hours are well above $6 billion.
According to data from on-chain analysis firm IntoTheBlock, the rally has put 62% of all DOGE holders in the green. For short sellers, the rally led to over 50 million worth of liquidations in the futures market during the unexpected short squeeze.
Even bigger numbers for DOGE
The new run has triggered renewed faith amongst enthusiasts that DOGE can surpass the $1 mark for the first time in its history. While it may appear to be a long shot, DOGE has several factors working for it that analysts say would be instrumental in reaching new highs.

First is the multiple reports that Musk’s Twitter could integrate DOGE as an option for tipping creators on the site.
“Now that Twitter is in the hands of Elon Musk I can see a real possibility that doge will somehow merge with the platform,” said Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder. 
Other accounts have shared a similar opinion with Matt Wallace, noting that integrating DOGE with Twitter will “showcase to the entire world what Dogecoin is capable of!”
Musk’s affinity with Dogecoin has been a long-running affair that peaked in 2021. The Tesla CEO had utilized his Twitter account to share Doge-related memes and appeared on Saturday Night Live to seemingly “promote” the asset.
In Jan 2022, Musk took things up a notch by announcing that Tesla customers can use DOGE to pay for merchandise and hinted that SpaceX could toe the same path in the coming months.

Bitcoin and the market are fighting back after the United States Federal Reserve’s Nov. 2 announcement of a 0.75 basis point interest rate hike that, at first, had a positive impact on equities and cryptocurrency markets, then led to a market downturn.
Despite the downward pressure, Bitcoin maintained the $20,000 price floor and now is over $21,000 as the general market responds to strong jobs numbers and employment data.

The jobs report shows that payrolls grew 261,000 in October as labor participation fell. The report sent equities upward as investors analyzed the numbers to show an overall resiliency in the market even against the expected Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate raise of 0.75%. 
As reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ether and BNB will likely remain closely correlated to U.S. equities and display the same price dynamics.

Crypto market performance. Source: CoinMarketCap
The current rally in BTC and altcoins could indicate an increase in confidence in the market following several key developments.
Here are three reasons why Bitcoin price rallied and then retraced today, and the details of key drivers of the growth.
Bitcoin open interest remains tilted toward short traders 
Since Bitcoin price crashed to $17,600 on June 18, the open interest of BTC futures contracts has been surging. Sharp price moves in Bitcoin price could trigger another liquidation event, but it is difficult to determine whether the move would be to the upside or downside.
Many traders agree that if the Fed were to pivot on its current policy of quantitative tightening and interest rate hikes, BTC price could surge to the upside and liquidate a significant portion of the short interest in futures contracts.
The current price move triggered a wave of liquidations, and one data point to keep an eye on is whether there is a sharp reduction in aggregate open interest. Data shows that $704 million in cross-crypto shorts were liquidated on Oct. 25, helping propel Bitcoin over $20,000.

Short liquidations directly help push Bitcoin price higher by forcing automated buy pressure. The current rally is seeing open interest gaining momentum after remaining consistent in October, which explains much of the sideways trading as well as the current rally.
Longer-term data is in Bitcoin’s favor, according to market analysts
Investors’ confidence in the crypto market could also be rising due to their belief that the United States Federal Reserve could roll out smaller-sized interest rate hikes in the next two months. 
In the Fed’s statement, the possibility of policy shift does remain open:
“In order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.”
According to MacroMicro, a firm that publishes investors’ consensus estimates on expected changes in interest rates, interest rates may be lower than previously anticipated in the near future.

The graph above points to a possible slowdown in interest rate hikes. The public sentiment shows that future rates may fall, and investors believe that this has created the possibility for a broad crypto market recovery.
The S&P 500 provides a general overview of the economy in general. Currently, Bitcoin and the S&P 500 share a high correlation coefficient.

Therefore, if interest rates ease and the economy grows, Bitcoin could reverse course if a similar turn-around were to take place in equities markets. The better the macro climate, the better for Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin’s sharp sell-offs could be a thing of the past
Bitcoin remaining over $20,000 is significant to traders who view the level as a major psychological support and resistance. On-chain data currently confirms that a $20,000 floor may not be purely speculative but also technically sound. 
Bitcoin’s realized price is currently concentrated between $17,000 and $22,000, highlighting a strong base of holders.

In addition to realized price distribution, Bitcoin long-term holders are not only still in profit, but 60% of all long-term holders are in profit.
Some investors might interpret Bitcoin’s current low volatility, steady consolidation within the $20,000 range and the unwillingness of sellers in the midst of the current equities-driven headwinds as a sign that the price has bottomed.

According to a press release issued at 12:30 p.m. UTC (i.e. 8:30 a.m. ET) today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 261,000 in October, and the unemployment rate rose to 3.7 percent.”
A report by CNBC said that while some people are concerned “that the Fed will persist with its hiking campaign as the labor market added 261,000 jobs,” there are others who “interpreted the findings as a sign that the labor market is beginning to cool — albeit at a slow pace.”
Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, told CNBC: “In an ironic way, a mixed report is probably a good report for the market because it shows the economy’s not falling off a cliff.“
Data by TradingView shows that on crypto exchange Bitstamp the Bitcoin price started surging as soon as the news release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics came out, and it got as high as $21,257 by 2:41 p.m. UTC.

;Dogecoin Whales Abandon Ship As DOGE Risks Falling To $0.10;;;0;https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-whales-abandon-ship-as-doge-risks-falling-to-0-10/;"Dogecoin whales have been on the move as DOGE price action calms down. With bulls taking a backseat, where could Dogecoin price be headed?
Dogecoin (DOGE), has been the center of attention for over 10 days as price action chalked up close to 140% gains. DOGE price rallied amid the hype of Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. 
While the DOGE rally was largely Musk and Twitter driven, at press time, amid negative sentiment from the Twitter layoffs and other news, Dogecoin price was trading in red. On Nov. 4, at the time of writing, DOGE price traded at $0.1271, or 2.86% down on the day. 
nd as the news of Twitter halting its plans to build a crypto wallet was reported, DOGE price sank further – plunging by almost 10% 
Social Euphoria Fading 
Dogecoin price peaked around the $0.158 level on Nov. 1 after which price started to make lower highs. Notably, social volumes and weighted social sentiment also peaked around the same time. Furthermore, transaction count for DOGE also presented a bearish divergence falling to near all-time low levels. A low transaction count presented how fewer successful transactions were happening on the blockchain.
Dogecoin Whales Fleeing?
As DOGE price spiked to a six-month-high, Dogecoin whales were seemingly tempted to take profits. A look at DOGE supply held by balance of addresses showed that most addresses holding a high number of DOGE coins had reduced their holding. Addresses holding 1,000-10,000 coins have reduced their holding most considerably, from 1.22% to 1.20%. 
Additionally, data from whale alert showed that 40,501,820 DOGE worth over $5 million was transferred from an unknown wallet to Binance. Generally, coins moving from wallets to exchanges means an attempt to liquidate and take profit. 
With DOGE whales acting skeptical the key price level to watch out for would be the $0.113 mark. Data from IntoTheBlock’s In and Out of Money Around the Price Indicator suggested that the $0.113 level could act as a solid support for DOGE but before that there’s not much support for bulls. 

Source: IntoTheBlock
At the $0.113 level, 11,400 addresses hold around 9.09 billion DOGE. However, in case of the bearish invalidation, if price takes a turn for the better, the $0.127 level can act as the next resistance where 40,870 addresses hold 2.4 billion DOGE. "
;XRP price surges over 8% in 24 hours boosted by events in Ripple’s SEC lawsuit;;;1;https://finbold.com/xrp-price-surges-over-8-in-24-hours-boosted-by-events-in-ripples-sec-lawsuit/;"
XRP is experiencing sustained buying pressure sparking a short-term rally amid the ongoing case with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. Notably, the gains are correlated with events deemed positive for the prospects of Ripple in the high-profile case. 

Indeed, by press time as of November 4, XRP was trading at $0.489, recording gains of almost 8% in the last 24 hours. The daily chart indicates that the token peaked at $0.5 before retracing, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Additionally, XRP could be poised to extend the rally if the token successfully breaks past and sustains the key $0.5 resistance level. In this line, if the token moves to retest the $0.55 barrier, it will likely hit the $0.60 mark putting the next target at $1. 
Elsewhere, the rally has been inspired by growing investor confidence, as reflected in the market capitalization. By press time, the asset controlled a market cap of $24.52 billion, adding over $1.62 billion within 24 hours.

Ripple receives industry support





In general, the spike in value for XRP centers around the SEC case after Ripple continued to receive support from different entities. In particular, on November 4, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that at least 12 entities involving developers, exchanges, associations, and investors were officially supporting the firm in the case. 
Some entities to express support for XRP include crypto exchange Coinbase, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Blockchain Association, Investor Choice Advocates Network (ICAN), and over 75,000 XRP holders. 
SEC’s motion 
Interestingly, the industry support comes as legal experts increasingly stated that the case where Ripple is accused of issuing XRP in violation of the SEC might be ruled in favor of the fintech firm. Such a scenario could be bullish for XRP and the general crypto market. 
Furthermore, the support for Ripple follows the November 3 SEC motion to extend the time to file all reply briefs until November 30. The regulator called on the presiding judge Analisa Torres to rule that any additional amicus briefs be filed by November 11."

His remarks were made during a fundraiser in Chicago on Friday, Bloomberg reported. Biden also said: ""There's no editors anymore,"" and asked: ""How do we expect kids to be able to understand what is at stake?""
The president's comments came shortly after Elon Musk acquired the social media giant — which is the platform of choice for the majority of individuals and projects in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry — for $44 billion.
The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has already removed most of Twitter's high-ranking executives and board and is reportedly firing about half of the company's employees.

Many, from individuals to civil rights groups to the president, have expressed concern about the potential lack of content moderation on a version of Twitter owned by Musk — a self-professed proponent of free speech.
Conversely, a multitude of crypto participants have taken a celebratory stance toward Musk's acquisition of the popular platform, as his free-speech stance may seem to align with the crypto ethos of censorship resistance.
Recently, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao — who commended a digital asset reports released by the Biden administration in September — said he’d be willing to join Twitter’s board of directors if invited by Musk.

	Under the new partnership, Solana Saga phones are all set to be powered by Helium Network’s newly launched 5G carrier services.
Solana’s widely anticipated Solana Saga phone has announced its partnership with newly launched Helium wireless carrier services.
The said collaboration will permit Solana Saga phones to access Helium’s seamless wireless carrier services, which will offer unlimited calling and messaging to users for up to 30 days.
Helium Network x Solana Saga
The founder of Helium Network, Nova Labs, had earlier announced its newest venture, dubbed “Helium Mobile,” with an intention to offer seamless 5G services to its customers residing in the US. The venture is still in its early stages of development and is due to launch in 2023.

As per the new details, the network is all set to expand its base up a notch and has recently announced a new collaboration with Solana Saga, a smartphone built by the Solana blockchain team.
According to a new announcement, the upcoming Solana Saga phones will be powered by Helium carrier service that will permit users to access the network’s newly launched 5G services. The announcement was made at Solana’s Breakpoint Conference in Lisbon earlier today.
Helium Network’s 5G services will also offer a free 30-day trial to its users based in the United States. Under the free trial rule, users will be able to make unlimited calls to their friends and family, followed by the option to send unlimited texts to anyone for a period of 30 days.
In an interview with Decrypt, Helium Network’s representative clarified that users will not be mandated to opt for Helium Network’s 5G services to use their Solana Saga phones; they can also select other carrier services as per their choice and preference.
“Not only will this partnership ultimately drive usage to the Helium Network, but Saga customers who sign up for Helium Mobile will be able to have a seamless and integrated user experience and could earn crypto rewards for using their cell service.” Boris Renski, general manager of Wireless Nova Labs, told Decrypt
The Solana Saga phone is dubbed one of the most widely anticipated smartphone launches of 2023. According to the official statement released by Solana, Saga smartphones will comprise “unique functionality and features tightly integrated with the Solana blockchain, making it easy and secure to transact in Web3 and manage digital assets, such as tokens and NFTs.”

;Bitfinex to List Content Creator Tokenization Platform XCAD;;;1;https://blog.bitfinex.com/media-releases/bitfinex-to-list-content-creator-tokenization-platform-xcad/;"ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands – November 7 2022 – Bitfinex (www.bitfinex.com/), a state-of-the-art digital token trading platform, announced today that it will be listing XCAD, the native token of the XCAD Network, a global tokenization platform that enables content creators to monetize their work. 
Built on the Zilliqa blockchain, the XCAD Network allows content creators on YouTube to issue their own creator tokens and mint NFTs for fans to purchase and trade. Content creators can apply to join the platform, and if accepted, their tokens are automatically launched for their fans to collect. Fans can then earn the tokens by simply downloading the XCAD web browser plug-in and watching creators’ content directly on YouTube. 
The XCAD Network was developed as a watch-to-earn model, whereby the more a creator’s content a fan watches, the more of those creator’s tokens that fan earns. This model ultimately gives fans a greater incentive to watch their favorite content creators’ work. The more tokens fans earn, the more influence they have in decisions relating to the channel.
Built to grant content creators additional ways to monetize their work and increase engagement, XCAD Network also houses its own XCAD DEX (decentralized exchange) for tokens to be swapped and sold, as well as a database called Influencer MarketCap that tracks and analyses the movement of creator tokens, and an NFT marketplace.
“We are delighted to welcome XCAD to Bitfinex,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Bitfinex. “XCAD has a vision to empower content creators to find additional ways to be rewarded for their work.”
“We’re extremely excited to kick off our growth campaign with Bitfinex, a tier one exchange,” said Oliver Bell, CEO and Co-Founder at XCAD Network.
XCAD Network reports that some of the most renowned YouTube influencers are backing XCAD Network, including stunt performer Mr Beast (with over 109 million subscribers), rapper and boxer KSI (with over 24 million subscribers), and joke vlogger Niko Omilana (with over 6 million subscribers). 
For access to XCAD on Bitfinex, customers can visit https://www.bitfinex.com/, following its listing.

Binance’s nonbinding letter of intent for the takeover – announced Tuesday as FTX’s financial position appeared to be spiraling out of control – hinged on Binance performing due diligence. Roughly half a day into that process of reviewing FTX’s internal data and loan commitments has led Binance to strongly lean against completing the transaction, the person said.

Binance declined to comment on the current status of the proposed deal. FTX also declined to comment.
After CoinDesk released this story, losses in the cryptocurrency and U.S. stock market worsened. Bitcoin (BTC) revisited its 2022 low of around $17,100, and ether (ETH) returning to its post-Merge low of $1,160. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) recently was down 5.2% from 24 hours earlier. The S&P 500, the benchmark for American equities, fell to its low of the day.

Backing out would be yet one more stunning step in a week of drama. CoinDesk a week ago published a scoop about the balance sheet of Alameda Research, the corporate sibling of FTX. The story prompted concerns about the financial stability of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, which includes both companies, leading to a liquidity crunch at FTX – a situation exacerbated Sunday when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said he would sell his holdings of the FTT cryptocurrency issued by FTX.

Binance then struck the deal after FTX had sought help from and was turned down by other large exchanges, Coinbase and OKX, according to people familiar with the matter."
